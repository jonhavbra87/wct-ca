        One of the best ways to ensure security on a website is to ensure the
        client have secure authorization and authentication. They must accept a
        log in through a thrusted third-party app (like Microsoft or OneLogin).
        Another method would be sanitization of data. This method is ensuring
        the data a system accepts is in the right format. Third option a client
        can use is continuous deployment or continuous integration (CD/CI). This
        is an automatic process of integrating code to production. Usually,
        CD/CI runs every change against some security checks and decides the
        delivery of the change to productions. For an example the client can use
        GitHub Actions. This allows the client to catch oversights from
        developers and helps maintain the reliability of the changes coming to a
        codebase.

        Every client also needs a network security. When you have good security
        of the network, then the client can protect themselves from unauthorized
        threats or exploits -unwanted malware. At last, the client can implement
        an automatic user timeout. This means that a user forgot to log out or
        left their credentials hanging in the browser, it will automatically
        sign out.
